As memorial of Joel Kallman, on this day utPLSQL launched its new website using different engine. We have moved away from using Jekyll with GitHub Pages to host project and organization sites. Jekyll was simply too much hussle and we used MkDocs to generate offline documentation for utPLSQL that was packaged into the release zip file. So instead of using two different methods, wei will now use only one. MkDocs is now used for both utPSLQL offline and for online organization and project pages. Thanks to wonderful material theme and mike (versioning plugin) for MkDocs you may now enjoy the following new features: dark & light theme better navigation and menu in utPLSQL documentation documentation version dropdown powerful and fast search within documentation Hopefully, you will like the changes and enhancements.
