## How to make an announcement post.

Create a File in the `_posts` directory with the file name of `YYYY-MM-DD-Blog-Post-Name.md`

This file will be a standard [Markdown file](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) which can be editing with any text editor although there are many offline and online editors for Markdown.

The file will also need a YAML Front Matter section at the top of the file.
